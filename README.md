# tml
Turing machine language. A (somehow) high-level language to describe programs running on Turing machines. The aim is pedagogical. In particular, this tool implements:
- [X] a non-deterministic machine for 3-coloring
- [X] Dijkstra's algorithm
- [ ] a non-deterministic machine for SAT
- [ ] Mathematical function (polynomials, etc.)
